    A little about myself, I am 15 years old and i am from Chicago. I am currently in highschool and will be a junior during this upcoming school year. At home I usually spend my time studying or doing homework but in my freetime I enjoy baking, watching my favorite shows, going to the beach or reading. <br>I also use that time to take care of my pet, my turtle. I also have a dog but she is taken care of by my grandmother. <br> <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/mGTRxk/IMG_3274.jpg" alt="IMG_3274" style="width:200px;height:150px;"border="0"> <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/cf5ZiQ/IMG_3605.jpg" alt="IMG_3605" style="width:150px;height:200px;" border="0">
    <br>I take part in girls who code programs as well the engineering program offered at my school. I am very interested in computer and software engineering. In the past I have been taught the basics of the programing languages, scratch, java and html. As well as participating in these programs, I was apart of a small group of girls to enter into the technovation challenge during 2016 and advanced to the semifinals. Our app's purpose was to bring money straight from parents and donors to highschool clubs of their choice. <br> <img src="https://crwg.uic.edu/files/2014/06/WISE-Girls.jpg" style="width:225px;height:1750x;">
